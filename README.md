# Basic_Html
This repository includes all the HTML fundamentals I practiced during *Week 1* of my web development journey with *SIGMA 8.0 by Apna College*.

## ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

This week, I focused on building a strong foundation in HTML. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what I explored:

- Creating buttons and hyperlinks that redirect to pages like Google and YouTube
- Structuring web content with headings, paragraphs, and semantic tags
- Designing lists, tables, and image sections
- Building forms and registration layouts with various input types
- Understanding inline and block elements like <div> and <span>
- Using HTML entities and basic formatting tags
- Creating my first resume using pure HTML

May this little collection help you in your own coding process too â€”  
as it did for me in building clarity, step by step. ðŸš€
